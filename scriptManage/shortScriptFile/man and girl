Alice smiled as she looked at her phone, seeing a message from her girlfriend, Sarah
They had been dating for almost a year now, and Alice still felt butterflies whenever Sarah sent her a message
She quickly replied, feeling her heart flutter as they chatted
Later that day, Sarah surprised Alice with a visit, holding a bouquet of flowers and a smile on her face
They spent the evening cuddled up on the couch, laughing and talking about everything and nothing at all
Alice couldn't believe how lucky she was to have such an amazing girlfriend
As the night wound down, Sarah leaned in for a kiss, and Alice felt her heart skip a beat
In that moment, she knew that she was in love with Sarah, and she never wanted to let her go
The two of them fell asleep wrapped up in each other's arms, knowing that their love was stronger than anything else in the world

Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved the ocean
He would spend hours playing on the beach and watching the waves crash against the shore
One day, the boy decided to go for a swim
As he splashed around in the water, he suddenly found himself being pulled out to sea by a strong current
The boy was scared but he didn't panic
Instead, he remembered his father's advice to swim parallel to the shore until he was out of the current
It took some time but the boy eventually made it back to shore, tired but safe
From that day on, he never underestimated the power of the ocean but continued to love and respect it for the rest of his life
The end

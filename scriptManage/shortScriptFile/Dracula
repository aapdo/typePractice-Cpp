Dracula was a mysterious figure, feared by many and revered by few
His pallid skin and sharp fangs were enough to send shivers down anyone's spine
He lived in a castle high in the mountains, away from the prying eyes of the world
But his solitude was broken when a group of tourists stumbled upon his abode
They were trapped in the castle, with no way out
Dracula toyed with them, teasing them with his powers and abilities
But gradually he grew fond of the visitors, and even helped them escape
And so, Dracula's legacy lived on, a fascination for generations to come
